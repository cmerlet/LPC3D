A code to do mesoscopic simulations of ions diffusing in carbon particles

This code was written by Céline Merlet, Anouar Belhboub and Anagha Sasikumar and was used in four published works:

"Mesoscopic simulations of the in situ NMR spectra of porous carbon based supercapacitors: Electronic structure and adsorbent reorganisation effects", Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 23, 15925 (2021), https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cp/d1cp02130c/unauth#!divAbstract

Here, a manual and input files for the three different types of simulations are provided.
