A code to do mesoscopic simulations of ions diffusing in carbon particles

This code was written by Céline Merlet and Anouar Belhboub and was used in two published works:

"Lattice simulation method to model diffusion and NMR spectra in porous materials”, Merlet et al., J. Chem. Phys., 142, 094701 (2015), http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/142/9/10.1063/1.4913368

“On the development of an original mesoscopic model to predict the capacitive properties of carbon-carbon supercapacitors", Belhboub et al., Electrochim. Acta, 327, 135022 (2019), https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468619318936

Here, a manual and input files for the three different types of simulations are provided.
